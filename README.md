# More mclx_fences (more_mclx_fences)
## Description
Adds fences and fence gates with bark textures for logs and hyphae. Despite using bark textures, the crafting recipe uses log/hypha blocks. Fences with bark can be stripped with axes. Hyphae fences are not flammable and cannot be used as fuel.

### Crafting
The crafting recipe for bark fences follows the same crafting format as plank fences, replacing planks with equivalent logs/hyphae.
